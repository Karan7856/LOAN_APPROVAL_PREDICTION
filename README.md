💰 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information and financial data.
We used a cleaned and balanced dataset and applied multiple classification models to build a robust prediction system.

📊 Project Overview
🔍 Goal: Predict loan approval status (approved/rejected) based on applicant details
📈 Models Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost
📊 EDA: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using bar plots, heatmaps, boxplots, and pairplots
✅ Best Accuracy: RANDOM FOREST with nearly 98% accuracy
